**Snake Game**:
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle Graphics module.

**How to Play**:
The goal of the game is to control a snake to eat the food and grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.
You can control the snake using the arrow keys:
Up Arrow: Move Up
Down Arrow: Move Down
Left Arrow: Move Left
Right Arrow: Move Right
The game ends when the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
**
Files Included:**
snake.py – Contains the Snake class that handles snake movements, creation, and growth.
food.py – Contains the Food class that generates food at random locations for the snake to eat.
scoreboard.py – Contains the Scoreboard class to keep track of the player's score and display game over messages.
main.py – The main game logic is found in this file (the script provided).
**How to Run:**
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where the files are located.

Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:


python main.py**:
**Game Rules****:
The snake moves continuously, and your job is to control its direction using the arrow keys.
Every time the snake eats the food, it grows in length, and your score increases.
The game ends if the snake:
Hits the wall.
Collides with its own body.
**Libraries Used**:
Turtle: Used for drawing graphics and creating the game interface.
Time: Used to control the speed of the snake's movement.
